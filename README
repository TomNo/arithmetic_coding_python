Fun exercise - re-implementing arithmetic coding - in order to try different
types of RNNs. Currently there is support for two types of simple statistical
model - adaptive and static. Static must be supplied during decompression 
phase. It is quite slow. 

Implementation is based on http://marknelson.us/2014/10/19/data-compression-with-arithmetic-coding/
and c++ source http://marknelson.us/attachments/2014/ari/ari.zip .
